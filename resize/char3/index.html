<span id="span1">You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue A little happy sunlight shining through there. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.</span>

<span id="span2">This is the fun part In your world you have total and absolute power. There comes a nice little fluffer. You can do it. We'll have a super time. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. Let your imagination be your guide. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything.</span>

<span id="span3">Take your time. Speed will come later. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. This is a fantastic little painting. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. </span>

<span id="span4">Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Here's another little happy bush Every day I learn. We need dark in order to show light. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. All kinds of happy little splashes. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Just make a decision and let it go. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</span>

<span id="span5">It should put happiness in your heart. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone.</span>

<span id="span6">You gotta think like a tree. You're meant to have fun in life. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</span>
